This is an example for the Generic Dijkstra algorithm, which was
proposed in:

Ireneusz Szcześniak, Andrzej Jajszczyk, Bożena Woźna-Szcześniak,
"Generic Dijkstra for Optical Networks", submitted for publication,
October 10, 2018.

This repository is the minimal example with the algorithm
implementation.
