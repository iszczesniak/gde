# The GD software

Implementation of the generic Dijkstra algorithm, which was proposed
in:

Ireneusz Szcześniak, Andrzej Jajszczyk, Bożena Woźna-Szcześniak,
"Generic Dijkstra for Optical Networks", Journal of Optical
Communications and Networking, vol. 11, issue 11, pp. 568-577,
November 2019

This repository has far more than just the algoritm implementation.
It's the whole simulator with the competing algorithms implemented.

## Download

You can download the implementation at:

<http://github.com/iszczesniak/gd>

Or you can use git:

`git clone --recurse-submodules http://github.com/iszczesniak/gd.git`

## A minimal project
